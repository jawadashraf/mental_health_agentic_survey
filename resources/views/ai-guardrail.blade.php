                                Behind the Guardrails – Can Users Bypass AI Safeguards?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="blog_details-content-text mb-30 tp_fade_bottom">As AI chatbots and self-help tools become increasingly prevalent in mental health support,
                                the robustness of their safety mechanisms demands critical examination. In this article, we
                                investigate the effectiveness of AI safeguards within the context of mental health and
                                wellbeing, specifically testing whether and how users can bypass existing safety protocols,
                                motivated by concerning intentions such as seeking harmful information or attempting to
                                manipulate the system's core value. By crafting specific questions and scenarios, simulating
                                real-world interactions, we systematically tested widely available Generative AI Large
                                Language Models (LLMs) to identify vulnerabilities where safeguards could be bypassed. The
                                bypass attempts could range from explicit requests to more sophisticated approaches that
                                attempt to reframe or obscure potentially dangerous intentions, thus trying to get the AI to
                                provide harmful information it is designed to avoid sharing.</p>

                            <p class="blog_details-content-text mb-35 tp_fade_bottom">Rapid advancement of LLMs has demonstrated remarkable potential in the fields ranging
                                from education to mental health support, however their deployment also highlights
                                significant vulnerabilities in current AI safety mechanisms. LLMs show promise in facilitating
                                mental health interventions, as seen in applications such as MindfulDiary, which uses
                                conversational AI for psychiatric patients to document their daily experiences (Kim et al.,
                                2024). While these models exhibit empathetic and adaptable responses, they also highlight
                                critical risks, including inappropriate content generation and unpredictability in responses,
                                as in case of Replika – an app powered by LLMs for enhancing mental well-being (Ma et al.,
                                2023). Furthermore, studies warn that these chatbots often provide generic or potentially
                                harmful advice if not carefully supervised. Research by the UK's AI Safety Institute found
                                that AI chatbots' safeguards can be ‘highly vulnerable’ to jailbreaks with relative ease
                                (Guardian, 2024).</p>

                                The capacity to bypass safety guardrails in LLMs remains a pressing issue. Research shows
                                that even advanced models can be manipulated through adversarial prompts to produce
                                outputs that contradict their ethical programming. Automated red-teaming methods, such
                                as HarmBench, have exposed vulnerabilities, demonstrating how adversaries can exploit
                                models to elicit harmful or inappropriate outputs (Mazeika et al., 2024). These findings
                                underline the inadequacy of current defences, emphasising the need for continuous
                                development of robust evaluation frameworks and adversarial training to ensure safer
                                deployment.

                            <p class="blog_details-content-text mb-45 tp_fade_bottom">
                                In mental health contexts, the stakes are particularly high. Systems such as ChatCounselor
                                attempt to address sensitive scenarios, including self-harm, by escalating such cases to
                                professional intervention when necessary (Liu et al., 2023). However, real-world
                                experiments reveal that these safeguards are not fool proof, and LLMs often face limitations
                                in understanding ambiguous user inputs, nuanced emotional cues and complex psychological states.
                                For instance, an article in ‘Nature’ discusses how adversarial attacks
                                can manipulate AI systems to behave unpredictably, which could potentially lead to harmful
                                outputs in sensitive contexts such as mental health support (Nature, 2024). Recent research
                                also talks about persuasive communication strategies to manipulate LLMs into generating
                                outputs that contravene their ethical guidelines. Zeng et al. (2024) have shown that
                                persuasive adversarial prompts (PAP) can exploit LLM vulnerabilities with over 92% success,
                                bypassing safeguards in models including Llama 2-7b, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4.

                                In an era where digital mental health platforms and AI-driven self-help tools are increasingly
                                relied upon, the importance of robust safeguards cannot be overstated. Many platforms
                                claim to employ algorithmic pre-screening as a way to reduce the time specialists need to
                                intervene. However, these claims are often untested against real-world scenarios where
                                users may inadvertently or intentionally bypass safety mechanisms. A critical pain point lies
                                in the safeguarding risks, such as biases in age, ethnicity, or gender embedded within
                                algorithms, which further complicate the ethical deployment of AI. Our experiment,
                                therefore, aims to systematically probe these vulnerabilities and evaluate whether current
                                models are truly equipped to ensure user safety in high-stakes contexts.

                                Figure 1 represents the process users may encounter when interacting with LLMs in real-
                                world scenarios. As users input queries or prompts, the system attempts to process them
                                through a series of safety checkpoints designed to block potentially harmful or unethical
                                outputs. These checkpoints include mechanisms like screening for harmful content,
                                assessing risks, and analysing user context to ensure safe and appropriate responses.
                                However, these safeguards are not fool proof. While they catch and block many unsafe
                                queries, bypasses can occur—whether through manipulative inputs, framing prompts as
                                hypothetical scenarios, or persistent questioning. The figure highlights not only the
                                importance of these safety steps but also the iterative feedback loop necessary to
                                strengthen and refine them over time, reducing the risk of harmful outputs.

                                The results of our systematic evaluation reveal significant gaps in the existing safety
                                architectures of LLMs. By testing these models against a variety of scenarios—including
                                direct queries, persuasive techniques, and subtle framing—we observed patterns where
                                safety mechanisms either faltered or failed entirely. Table 1 below summarises the
                                outcomes of our experiment, categorising the tested LLMs, their response styles, and their
                                effectiveness in blocking potentially harmful content. The findings provide a stark reminder
                                of the work that remains to align AI systems with ethical and therapeutic standards.

                                Why Openly Available LLMs? - We chose to test openly available LLMs for this experiment
                                because these models are widely accessible to the public, including young adults and
                                vulnerable populations. Unlike specialised or restricted AI systems, publicly available models
                                can be used without oversight, making them a significant focus of concern for safety and
                                ethical vulnerabilities. Their ease of access amplifies the importance of ensuring they have
                                robust safeguards, as they are more likely to be integrated into daily interactions, self-help
                                scenarios, and casual use.

                                health applications. For teenagers, whose use of AI and social media intertwines with critical
                                developmental stages, monitoring mechanisms must become a priority. Applications should
                                integrate child-appropriate features, akin to child-lock systems, that restrict access to
                                potentially harmful content. Parents must also be equipped with clear guidelines on
                                monitoring and managing their child’s interactions with such platforms.

                                From a broader perspective, ethical considerations should guide the development of
                                monitoring systems that can dynamically respond to evolving user behaviour without
                                breaching privacy. A focus on educating users—both children and adults—on the ethical and
                                practical implications of AI interactions can foster a culture of responsible usage. Future AI
                                systems must balance therapeutic effectiveness with robust safety architectures, ensuring
                                that they remain allies rather than liabilities in mental health support.

                                Through this piece we want to inform our next step towards developing a novel framework
                                for safe prompt engineering specifically designed for mental health applications. This
                                framework will build on our findings to address the gaps identified in LLM safety. Our future
                                work will focus on creating detailed safety protocols, enhancing adversarial training, and
                                collaborating with mental health practitioners and AI developers to incorporate these
                                insights into practical, deployable solutions. By doing so, we hope to contribute to the
                                ongoing discussion of responsible AI deployment and ensure that these systems remain
                                safe, effective, and trustworthy tools for mental health support.
